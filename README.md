# Simple Hangman

This is a simple version of the Hangman game. Run `hangman.py` to play. The hidden word will be randomly selected from `HIDDEN_WORDS.txt`. You can replace this text file with a word dictionary of your choice for more variety in the random selection.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/evelynle28/simple-hangman.git
$ python3 hangman.py
```
